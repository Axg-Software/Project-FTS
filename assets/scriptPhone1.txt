PhoneGuy (Kyle): "Hello? Hello?! Hey umm, welcome to your first job as the night guard for the Shitty ass bathroom next to your room."
PhoneGuy (Kyle): "Now theres a few 'Animatronics' you need to look out for. So I'm going to show you the ropes, and how to make them not attack you!"
PhoneGuy (Kyle): "First is Cupcake, you will find him in the bathroom to your left. and to make him Not go towards you at night."
PhoneGuy (Kyle): "You will need to either: look at him while hes still in the bathroom, or to look at cameras. Simple!"
PhoneGuy (Kyle): "Next is Foxy. To stop him from going towards you at night you need to: Open the shower curtain and make him go all the way down."
PhoneGuy (Kyle): "Next is Bonnie, you need to turn the water on when you hear a noise in the bathroom! Then turn it off after."
PhoneGuy (Kyle): "And finally is Freddy. When you hear a knocking sound in your left ear you need to turn off the lights."
PhoneGuy (Kyle): "And when you feel its safe, you need to turn on the lights again and check to see if hes there. And if he isnt your chillin'!"
PhoneGuy (Kyle): "And if he is, just repeat until he isn't anymore!"
PhoneGuy (Kyle): "Also another way you could get rid of him is to press the 'Reset Freddy Position' button in the cameras but that takes away 5 power"
PhoneGuy (Kyle): "So you are now all caught up on how not to have the ki-, 'Animatronics' to not get into your bathroom!"
PhoneGuy (Kyle): "Umm Bye!"
